#### I am Hugo, nice to meet you!

![profile](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}.

I have two years of software development in Python and I am passionate about building and maintaining
web applications that are capable of processing large amounts of data. I graduated Cum Laude in May 2019
from St. Olaf College (USA) in Computer Science with a concentration in Statistics.

I am passionate about developing scalable and reliable software using modern tools like Docker containers.
My experience includes developing software in C++, implementing and using machine learning algorithms in the R language,
and setting up web servers and reverse proxies using NGINX.

Below, you can find a couple of my latest projects:

1. Web Development on High Performance Computing in Context (HiPerCiC) project at St. Olaf College led by a faculty member.
This my undegraduate research position.
Since the code is closed source, here are some statistics describing my contributions:

    * 376 commits across four Git repositories, mostly Python with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    * Set up 3 virtual machines, two running production code
    * Automated continuous integration and deployment to staging and production
    * Designed reverse proxying to 6 VMs and set up SSL termination at each VM
    * Followed Audrey Roy and Daniel Roy Greenfeld's Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.11 and other materials on best practices with Python and Django
    * Pioneered deployment to clusters (Kubernetes on premise and in Google Cloud)
    * Leader of a team with four other students, reported to faculty member who founded and directed the project

2. [Python package development (click)](https://github.com/Sygic/sygic-maps-services-python) and data generation using Python's Pandas and geospatial data while interning at Sygic
3. [Machine Learning: Student performance analysis (click)](mlearn.html) in collaboration with Bridget Koehler and Evan Holmes, used a dataset from UCI and various algorithms (My sections are Linear Model, SVM, Hierarchical Cluster) to analyze student performance in two schools in Portugal. This was a final project for a class at St. Olaf College
4. [Airbnb Price Influencer Analysis (click)](airbnb-price-influencer-analysis.html) in collaboration with Xiaotian Fan, used a dataset from insideairbnb.com to analyze which factors influence the price of an Airbnb listing for places in Amsterdam, the Netherderlands. This was also a final project for a class at St. Olaf College.
