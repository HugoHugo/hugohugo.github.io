## About Me

I am a Data Scientist working on Machine Learning. Specifically, implementing algorithms
and training models available through Scikit-learn and TensorFlow focused on sales data or
other structured data. I have a good knowledge of Spark and plenty of practice with highly scalable PySpark code.

As to my education, I graduated Cum Laude from St. Olaf College (Minnesota, USA) with a degree in Computer Science, and a minor in Statistics.
During my time at St. Olaf College, I gained two years of undergraduate research experience in software development in Python. Particularly,
using Django (web framework) to develop sort of a backoffice tool for other researchers to deploy projects using CI/CD and onto Kubernetes.

I am passionate about developing scalable and reliable software running in modern environments like Docker containers.
My experience includes implementing and using machine learning algorithms in the R language,
and setting up web servers and reverse proxies using NGINX and Gunicorn that run on clusters.

I have an appreciation for the mathematics powering ML algorithms and apply my knowledge of Big-O to optimize the ML solutions I created for RAM and CPU complexity.

## Past Projects

Below, you can find a few of my latest projects by language:

- [Python](#python)
- [R](#r)


### Python

1. [Python package development (click)](https://github.com/Sygic/sygic-maps-services-python) and geographical data generation using Geopandas and shape approimation techniques through different Python packages. Developed a generator of locations around the world for every country in Python, which was then run on a Hadoop cluster.
2. Web Development on High Performance Computing in Context (HiPerCiC) project at St. Olaf College led by a faculty member.
This my undegraduate research position in software development.
Since the code is closed source, here are some statistics describing my contributions:
    - 376 commits across four Git repositories, mostly Python with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end. Also wrote basic scripts in Bash.
    - Object-Oriented programming
    - Set up 3 virtual machines, two running production code
    - Automated continuous integration and deployment to staging and production
    - Designed reverse proxying to 6 VMs and set up SSL termination at each VM
    - Followed Audrey Roy and Daniel Roy Greenfeld's Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.11 and other materials on best practices with Python and Django
    - Pioneered deployment to clusters (Kubernetes on premise and in Google Cloud)
    - Leader of a team with four other students, reported to faculty member who founded and directed the project

### R

1. [Machine Learning: Student performance analysis (click)](mlearn.html) in collaboration with Bridget Koehler and Evan Holmes, used a dataset from UCI and various algorithms (My sections are Linear Model, SVM, Hierarchical Clustering) to analyze student performance in two schools in Portugal. This was a final project for a class at St. Olaf College
2. [Airbnb Price Influencer Analysis (click)](airbnb-price-influencer-analysis.html) in collaboration with Xiaotian Fan, used a dataset from insideairbnb.com to analyze which factors influence the price of an Airbnb listing for places in Amsterdam, the Netherderlands. This was also a final project for a class at St. Olaf College.
