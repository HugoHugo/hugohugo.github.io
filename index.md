## About Me

Technological leader and Python developer with experience in machine learning and big data software development. Currently leading a department of Golang software engineers and Python Data Scientists. Working across languages to design low-latency, high-value services that combine state-of-the-art software engineering with actionable insights from machine learning.

I am comfortable and knowledgeable in statistical data analysis, time series data analysis, analyzing large data sets (terabytes of data) as well as experience working with cross-sectional teams and data, such as sales and analytics data across a variety of industries.

My experience also includes architecting medium to large scale software projects that are built with security by design, conformant to stakeholder requirements, and running at acceptable cost. All of my work is cloud-native and primarly focused on Google Cloud.
