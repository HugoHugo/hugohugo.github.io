#### I am Hugo, nice to meet you!

![profile](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}.

I have two years of software development in Python and I am passionate about building and maintaining
web applications that are capable of processing large amounts of data.

I am passionate about developing scalable and reliable software using modern tools like Docker containers.
My experience includes developing software in C++, implementing and using machine learning algorithms in the R language,
and setting up web servers and reverse proxies using NGINX.

Below, you can find a couple of my latest projects:

1. Web Development on High Performance in Computing project at St. Olaf College
2. Python package development and data generation while interning at Sygic
3. [Machine Learning: Student performance analysis (click)](mlearn.html) using a dataset from UCI and various algorithms (My sections are Linear Model, SVM, Hierarchical Cluster) final project for a class at St. Olaf College
